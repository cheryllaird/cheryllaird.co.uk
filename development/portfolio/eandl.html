<p>The in-house web team at E&L Insurance is responsible for creating bespoke and efficient websites for the company to sell their products.</p>

<p>My job role at E&L Insurance requires me to lead a small front-end team and assist with the development of numerous websites, whilst producing clean, scalable code. Alongside this, I also hold responsibility for creating new, fresh designs and maintaining older designs if necessary.</p>
