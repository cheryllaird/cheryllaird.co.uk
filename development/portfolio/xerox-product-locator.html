<p>The Xerox Product Locator is a tool which allows customers to easily locate relevant products by answering a few simple questions. The objective is to direct customers to a targeted set of results, in accordance to the answers they provide, so they can stay focused on the products that meet their business needs.</p>

<p>The tool effectively reduces the time spent on researching and comparing Xerox's product offerings and helps to easily identify a product for the customer to buy or further research.</p>

<p>For this project I was individually involved in the full project cycle, from the wireframing and design, through to the full development and testing of the tool. One of the key requirements was to implement responsive design and to optimise the usability appropriately for multiple platforms.</p>
