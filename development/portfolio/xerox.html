<p>As a global company, Xerox obtains an extensive web presence. My job role at Xerox required me to assist with the on-going development of Xerox.com, across a multilingual platform.</p>

<p>Whilst at Xerox I developed sustainable internet solutions to support Xerox technology, services and customers. Typically, I was involved in the full project lifecycle, tasks could range from capturing customer requirements, creating wireframes and mock-ups to the actual development, testing and maintenance of the delivered product.</p>
